# Weather Dashboard

This is a weather dashboard application that uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities. The application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The user can search for a city and view current and future weather conditions for that city. The application also stores search history using localStorage.

## User Story

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
